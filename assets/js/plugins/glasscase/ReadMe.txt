Hello,

thank you for choosing GlassCase plugin!

Before starting to use our plugin, take a look at:

Documentation:
	http://tinycomp.net/products/glasscase/documentation.aspx
  
Examples (demos):
	http://tinycomp.net/products/glasscase/glasscase.aspx

GlassCase zip will have 3 folders: 
	- documentation: 			will hold the offline version of the plugin documentation;
	- glasscase_development: 	will hold the un-minified version of css and js files;
	- glasscase_production: 	will hold the minified version of css and js files.
	
General structure:
/css    -> this folder holds the css file 
/fonts  -> this folder holds the fonts*(Linea Iconset), that are used for creating the icons for the component
/images -> this folder contains loader.gif, that is used by the component
/js     -> this folder holds the js file(s)

*Linea Iconset(http://linea.io/) is released for free under the license CC BY 4.0.

We really hope it serves you.

Best regards,
